# Inter-VLAN-routing
Inter-VLAN routing is used to establish communication between several VLANs. There are three types of VLANs availble. They are physical cabling, router-on-a-stick (ROAS), and switch virtual interfaces (SVI).

## 01 Router-on-a-stick (ROAS)
- Add a router
- Then, trunk the port in the relevant switch
- Next, turn on the port in the router
- Next, create the sub-interfaces that you want in the router
